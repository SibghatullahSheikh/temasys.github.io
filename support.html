            <h3>Trouble getting things to work?</h3>
            <p>Ah, bummer! Here are a few things you can do:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Our projects usually include tests. Please make sure they run successfully on your system. You'll find instructions on how to run them in the projects description or README.md file.</li>
                <li>Checkout the <i>Issues</i> section of the project you're using and see if there's already an issue on file.</li>
                <li>Our staff hangs out a lot on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">stackoverflow.com</a>. If you create a question there with the project name as tag (e.g. <code>skywayjs</code> or <code>adapterjs</code>) we'll find it and reply within a working day. This way you're also helping the community, if they're having a similar problem in the future.
                <li>Worst case, write us an email directly to <i>dev-support</i> at <i>temasys.com.sg</i></li>
            </ol>
        </li>

            <h3>Found bugs or issues?</h3>
            <p>We're working hard to make sure the projects are bugfree. In case you encounter something that just doesn't work, please file it in the <i>Issues</i> section of the project on GitHub. If you already have the fix in place, that's awesome! Please read on:</p>

            <h3>Contributing</h3>
            <p>We publish our projects here as open-source, because the web is constant motion and for a small team like ours it sadly sometimes happens that we miss things. Therefor we appreciate everybody who is willing to contribute, by filing bugs, submitting bugfixes and enhancements. The easiest way to do the latter is by using GitHub Pull Requests. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests" target="_blank">Here is how they work.</a></p>
        </li>
         <li>
            <h3>Join the team!</h3>
            <p>We are always looking for web developers who want to join us on our mission to make the web communicate more. Send us a short CV, a link to your GitHub profile and highlight what you're most proud of and interested in. We'll get back to you! Here is the email: <i>jobs</i> at <i>temasys.com.sg</i></p>

            <h3>Licenses</h3>
            <p>All our projects are available under the Apache 2.0 license. (<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html" target="_blank">original</a>, <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2.0-(apache-2.0)" target="_blank">tl;dr</a>)</p>
